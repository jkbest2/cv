  abstract = {Bayesian state-space surplus production models are commonly applied in fisheries stock assessment when the only information available is an index of relative abundance. However, even relatively simple models such as these can be computationally expensive to fit, and diagnosing poor fits can be difficult. The Stan software package provides an advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler and diagnostics that are not available in other packages for fitting Bayesian models. Here the sampler diagnostics, efficiency, and posterior inferences are compared among multiple parameterizations of a state-space biomass dynamics model, using both Pella-Tomlinson and Schaefer dynamics. Two parameterizations that prevent predictions of negative biomass are introduced, one of which allows for errors in catch. None of the parameterizations used avoid diagnostic warnings using the default sampler parameter values. Choosing the appropriate parameterization of a model, and paying attention to these diagnostics can increase computational efficiency and make inferences more robust.},

  abstract = {Fish populations with spatial structure inherently violate the assumption of a single well-mixed stock, necessitating the use of spatially-structured population dynamics models. Accounting for spatial structure accurately and easily is a major goal for the next generation of stock assessment software development. Reference points (e.g., limit or target harvest rates and their associated biomass) are inherent to stock assessments and are often calculated under equilibrium conditions. However, the calculation process can be challenging for spatially-structured population dynamics models. We outline how to calculate equilibrium quantities within spatially-structured models where density-dependence in recruitment is local. We compare those values to equivalent situations when density-dependence in recruitment is global, thereby extending the set of population dynamics models on which spatially-structured stock assessments could be based. Results suggest that our method for calculating reference points under the assumption of local density-dependence can be performed using a straightforward optimization routine, and provide clearer understanding of the effects of fishing on a spatially-structured population. Finally, we address areas of research and development needed to integrate spatially-structured population dynamics models within existing management systems.},

  abstract = {The recovery of whale populations from centuries of exploitation will have important management and ecological implications due to greater exposure to anthropogenic activities and increasing prey consumption. Here, a Bayesian population model integrates catch data, estimates of abundance, and information on genetics and biology to assess the recovery of western South Atlantic (WSA) humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Modelling scenarios evaluated the sensitivity of model outputs resulting from the use of different data, different model assumptions and uncertainty in catch allocation and in accounting for whales killed but not landed. A long period of exploitation drove WSA humpback whales to the brink of extinction. They declined from nearly 27 000 (95\% PI = 22 800\textendash 33 000) individuals in 1830 to only 450 (95\% PI = 200\textendash 1400) whales in the mid-1950s. Protection led to a strong recovery and the current population is estimated to be at 93\% (95\% PI = 73\textendash 100\%) of its pre-exploitation size. The recovery of WSA humpback whales may result in large removals of their primary prey, the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), and has the potential to modify the community structure in their feeding grounds. Continued monitoring is needed to understand how these whales will respond to modern threats and to climate-driven changes to their habitats.},
